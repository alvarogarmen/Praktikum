## Shortest Path Finde

This code was developed as part of my beginnerÂ´s practical at the Algorithm Engineering Group at Heidelberg University. 
It is a command-line program that calculates the shortest path between two nodes on a given graph. The input graph needs to follow the METIS convention. In order to run the program type
praktikum.exe --source=<node ID> --target=<node ID> --graph=<path to file>.
The shortest path length will be printed on the console as well as some information on the time taken by the different algorithms (Dijkstra, A* and ALT).
