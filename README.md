## Shortest Path Finder

This code was developed as part of my beginnerÂ´s practical at the Algorithm Engineering Group at Heidelberg University. 
It is a command-line program that calculates the shortest path between two nodes on a given graph. The input graph needs to follow the METIS convention. In order to run the program type: <br>
\praktikum.exe --source=\<node ID\> --target=\<node ID\> --graph=\<path to file\>. <br>
The shortest path length will be printed on the console as well as some information on the time taken by the different algorithms (Dijkstra, A* and ALT).
<br>
There are also some Jupyter Notebook scripts to plot the resulting running times and search spaces.
